    It's like Shazam, but for food!

    Aviato SeeFood uses on-device machine learning to answer the only
    question that truly matters: is it a hotdog, or is it not a hotdog?

    Inspired by the iconic SeeFood concept, this is the food-identification
    technology the world has been waiting for.

    Features:
    • Snap a photo or pick from your library
    • Instant on-device classification — no internet required
    • Simple, definitive results: HOTDOG or NOT HOTDOG
    • Works on iPhone and iPad
    • Dreamfold Liquid Glass design

    All processing happens entirely on your device. No images are uploaded,
    no data is collected, and no network connection is needed.

    notes: |
      This app performs all image classification on-device using Core ML.
      No images leave the device. No personal data is collected, stored,
      or transmitted. No analytics or tracking SDKs are included.

  review_notes: |
    This is a novelty/entertainment app inspired by the "Not Hotdog"
    concept from a popular TV comedy. The app uses MobileNetV2 via
    Core ML to classify photos as either "hotdog" or "not hotdog."
    To test: take a photo of any food item or object. No login or
    account is required. All processing is on-device.
