    Is it a hotdog? Or is it not a hotdog? Find out instantly!

    HotDog uses on-device machine learning to determine whether the item
    in your photo is a hotdog — or not a hotdog. Inspired by the iconic
    app from HBO's Silicon Valley, this novelty app brings Jian-Yang's
    dream to life.

    Features:
    • Snap a photo or pick from your library
    • Instant on-device classification — no internet required
    • Simple, fun results: HOTDOG or NOT HOTDOG
    • Works on iPhone and iPad

    All processing happens entirely on your device. No images are uploaded,
    no data is collected, and no network connection is needed.

  review_notes: |
    This is a novelty/entertainment app inspired by the "Not Hotdog" app
    from HBO's Silicon Valley (Season 4). The app uses MobileNetV2 via
    Core ML to classify photos as either "hotdog" or "not hotdog."
    To test: take a photo of any food item or object. The app will tell
    you whether it is a hotdog or not. No login or account is required.
    All processing is on-device.
