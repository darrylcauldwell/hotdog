Is it a hotdog? Or is it not a hotdog? Find out instantly!

HotDog uses on-device machine learning to determine whether the item in your photo is a hotdog — or not a hotdog. Inspired by the iconic app from HBO's Silicon Valley, this novelty app brings Jian-Yang's dream to life.

Features:
• Snap a photo or pick from your library
• Instant on-device classification — no internet required
• Simple, fun results: HOTDOG or NOT HOTDOG
• Works on iPhone and iPad

All processing happens entirely on your device. No images are uploaded, no data is collected, and no network connection is needed.
